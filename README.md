# Football-Manager

Aim of this project which was done by me in 2016 is to learn about object-oriented programming.

In this project, user can select a league to play in and a team to play with.
After taking control of the team, user is allowed to make transfers. To make it
clear, every team has some amount of money which can be earned by getting
good results from matches and every footballer has a value which is calculated
from their powers. To make a transfer, user’s team should have amount of
money that is equal or bigger than the value of the player that user wants to buy.
User can also arrange the tactic of the team. There are 2 different tactics which
are defensive and attacking tactics. User can change his/her team’s tactic during
the matches or before the matches. After every match, user can see the results of
the games of the week and the league point table. Also, user is allowed to see the
squads of the league teams which are consist of the footballers of the teams
